            My passion for problem solving began since my 10th grade and that
            have made me better today than I was yesterday. I code, build,
            design & scale full-stack web applications.

            I am a focused driven developer, and I currently work at RBCUK LTD,
            United Kingdom.

            I love my work, it has allowed me to understand development of
            digital products and how it affects our users.

            Previously, I've worked with startups and participate in community
            driven initiatives. I worked multiple roles; ranging from being a
            Backend, DevOps to Full-stack developer. These days, I am more
            focused on experimentation, strategy, analysis and backend
            implementation of products.
